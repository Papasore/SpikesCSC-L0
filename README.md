# SpikesCSC-L0
The CSC-L0 algorithm is a method based on template matching using a L0 constraint on activations for solving Spike Sorting problems.

# Main goals
Our objective is to provide a solution to spike sorting activities for large HD-MultiArrayElectrodes devices. This project uses the SpikeInterface framework and evaluation is performed based on benchmarked datasets provided by the SpikeForest project.
